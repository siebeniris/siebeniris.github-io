__ITFLOWS H2020, European Project__

* [https://www.itflows.eu/](https://www.itflows.eu/)
* __Description__: The purpose of ITFlows is to provide accurate predictions and adequate management solutions of migration flow in the European Union during the phases of reception, relocation, settlement, and integration of migrants. These insights will be provided with the help of EUMigraTool and precise models. Start Date: September 2020.

## Repositories

### MigrationsKB- The Knowledge Base of Migraiton related annotated Tweets
__MigrationsKB(MGKB)__ is a public Knowledge Base of anonymized __Migration__ related 
annotated tweets. The MGKB currently contains over 200 thousand 
tweets, spanning over 9 years (January 2013 to July 2021), 
filtered with 11 European countries of the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Poland, France, Sweden, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Netherlands and Italy. 
__Metadata__ information about the tweets, such as Geo information (__place name, coordinates, country code__). __MGKB__ contains __entities, sentiments, hate speeches, topics, hashtags, encrypted user mentions__ in RDF format. 
The __schema__ of MGKB is an extension of TweetsKB for migrations related information. 
Moreover, to associate and represent the potential __economic and social factors__ driving the migration flows such as eurostat, statista, etc. 
FIBO ontology was used. The extracted economic indicators, such as GDP Growth Rate, are connected with each Tweet in RDF using geographical and temporal dimensions. The user IDs and the tweet texts are encrypted for privacy purposes, while the tweet IDs are preserved.

### Multilingual MigrationsKB

__Multilingual MigrationskB (MGKB)__ is a mulitlingual extended version of English __MGKB__. 
The tweets geotagged with Geo location from __32 European Countries__ 
( Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech, Denmark, 
Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, 
Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, 
Spain, Sweden, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, 
the United Kingdom ) are extracted and filtered by __11 languages__
(English, French, Finnish, German, Greek, Dutch, Hungarian, Italian, 
Polish, Spain, Swedish). Metadata information about the tweets, such as Geo information (place name, coordinates, country code) are included.

### Temporal Evolution of the Migration-related Topics on Social Media
This poster focuses on capturing the temporal evolution of
migration-related topics on relevant tweets. It uses __[Dynamic Embedded
Topic Model (DETM)](https://github.com/adjidieng/DETM)__ as a learning algorithm to perform a quantitative
and qualitative analysis of these emerging topics. TweetsKB is extended
with the extracted Twitter dataset along with the results of DETM which
considers temporality. These results are then further analyzed and visualized. It reveals that the trajectories of the migration-related topics are in
agreement with historical events.

### Interpretable Change Point Detection in Review Streams 
__Change point detection__ (CPD) has become increasingly important in time series analysis. There have been many well functioning algorithms for change point detection. However, little attention has been paid to evaluating the performance of change point detection algorithms on real-word time series, let alone natural language real-world time series. In this thesis, we create a dataset from real-world data of hotel reviews and use this dataset as ground truth to evaluate various CPD algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset specifically designed to evaluate change point detection algorithms in natural language processing, which potentially provides a realistic benchmark dataset in this area.

### Argumentation in Dialogues
Adress the following questions:
- How can we extract argument segments in dialogues that clearly express a particular argument facet? (such as morality, Second Amendament)
- How can we recognize that two argument segments are semantically similar, i.e., about the same facet of the argument?
